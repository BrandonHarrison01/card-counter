# Card Counter

The blackjack card counter is a web app designed for mobile use. The purpose of the app is to help the consumer practice their card counting skills

## My Role
This was an app I worked on solo in order to practice JavaScript logic and React Hooks

## Project Difficulties
At the time I had a hard using logic in React

## My Solution
I referenced a few past assignments and was able to figure out how to apply it directly to my vision of the app

## Notable Features
* Dynamically calculates the odds of the next card to be flipped in a deck
* Odds and cards remaining are color coded to enable user to easily read the output
